        <h2>The Staffs of a Wizard</h2>
        <p>
            A Wizard cannot perform all the mystical duties that come with being a Wizard, if they’ve no Staff. 
             A staff could be helpful on a walk, it may look cool, but a staff is much more. 
              The weapon of a Wizard, capable of causing calamities of destruction is not to be scoffed at.  
            An insurmountable amount of wood variations, and magic channeling stones, 
            the power that comes with them is to be considered equally.

            <h4>Mana Reception</h4>
            <p>
                Has to do with the efficacy of a stones capability to pull in a Wizards mana. 
                 A stone with good mana reception can efficiently source ones mana without overuse. 
                 In some cases it can even require less than what is needed.

        <div class="potency">
            <h4>Spell Potency</h4>
            <p>
                The strength of a spell.  The more potent, the more effective in doing its desired task.

            <h4>Wood Density</h4>
            <p>
                In simple terms, it is just how durable a wood type is.  
                This will also make it slightly heavier, but able to withstand stronger magics.

    <!--WOOD TYPES-->

        <div class="wood-header">
            <h2>Wood Types</h2>
            <p>All staffs are constructed of a special type of Wood and a Crystal to match.  
                The Wood is what make the staff alive.  
                The Wood type will heavily determine what that staff can perform. Wood density, plays a big role in what a staff can output.  
                In addition, some Wood types amplify certain spells potency.  
                While there are numerous amounts of Wood types, what we have presented here are some of the more well known and sought after ones. 
            </p>

        <div class="mahogany">
            <h3>Midland Mahogany</h3>
            <h4>Type - All Arounder</h4>
            <p>
                Mahogany is a very standard wood. 
                 Overall, there is nothing special about it, but it also shouldn't be overlooked.  
                Its a great starter style wood, and can endure a good deal of spells.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="oak">
            <h3>Orcs Oak</h3>
            <h4>Type - Fire and Wind Amplifier<br>
                Slightly Dense
            </h4>
            <p>
                Orcs Oak is not necessarily rare, but its not common either.  
                Since it is a slightly dense wood, it can handle a lot of magical strain.  
                Since these trees only grow in Orc lands, it is believed that due to the orcs destructive nature, 
                this wood amplifies Fire and Wind type spells.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="darkwood">
            <h3>Elven Darkwood</h3>
            <h4>Type - Earth Amplifier<br>
                Very Dense
            </h4>
            <p>
                This wood only grows among the forest of the Woodland Elves.  
                It is rare they even spare such a material for outsiders.  
                This wood has built a great connection with the Earth and the Elves alike. 
                 Due to this, this wood greatly strengthens Earth type magics.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="whitewood">
            <h3>Elven Whitewood</h3>
            <h4>Type - Healing Amplifier<br>
                No Density
            </h4>
            <p>
                Elven Whitewood, as its name states, is very white.
                  It grows only within the realm of the High Elves, and is equally as rare to come by as the Elven Darkwood.
                    It has a powerful amplification on healing spells, which makes it all the more valuable.
                      It is said the wood is so light that if you were to use any spell other than healing, the wood will shatter instantly.  
                      This is because the wood has such a will to provide aid, that if it were to do anything else, 
                      it’s spirit would break causing it to shatter.

            <h3>Grand Marblewood</h3>
            <h4>Type - Lightening Amplifier<br>
                Medium Density
            </h4>
            <p>
                Unlike most woods, this one has a brilliant marble pattern of light and dark woods.  
                Its brilliant striations form lightening-esque patterns throughout the whole wood.  
                Fittingly it is a great lightening type amplifier.  
                These trees only grow on tall mountains closer to its summit. 
                 According to tales, these trees are often struck by lightening from being so high up.  
                 This not only explains it affinity with lighting, but also its marble pattern.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="kingswood">
            <h3>Royal Kingswood</h3>
            <h4>Type - Water Amplifier<br>
                High Density
            </h4>
            <p>
                Royal Kingswood grows specifically in the Royal Capital. 
                 According to legend, when the Royal Capital was first erected, the First King planted this tree. 
                  The Royal Family bloodline is known for their unique affinity with water.  
                  It is said that is where this woods properties come from.  
                  Royal Kingswood is used in all of the Royal Guards weapons, including their Wizard Infantry’s staffs. 
                  The odds of someone other than a Royal Guard possessing such a wood is extremely unlikely.

            <h3>Goblins Bloodwood</h3>
            <h4>Type - Fire Amplifier<br>
                Low Density
            </h4>
            <p>
                Stained with the blood of goblins, this wood is not exactly ‘desirable’.  
                Its casting power is quite good, but it is known to be disobedient.  
                Often times it will not cast at its owners call.  Most would be wise to avoid the wood altogether.

    <!--MAGIC CRYSTALS-->

    <section id="magic-crystals">
        <div class="crystal-header">
            <h2>Magic Crystals</h2>
            <p>
                Magic Crystals sit at the top of the staff, and of course, control a mages flow of mana into the staff to conduct a spell. 
                 A Crystal will often choose it’s Wizard.  Such a connection will further improve mana flow through the staff, and Spell potency.  
                 If a Wizard were to happen upon any old staff, in most cases the staff would not follow that Wizard due to it having no connection.  
                 Here we showcase an array of different crystal types.  
                Though its shape and size have minimal effect, it is good to know what to look for when you’re out and about.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="rounded">
            <h3>Rounded Crystal</h3>
            <h2>Common</h2>
            <p>
                Rounded Crystals are the most common crystals found.  
                Due to their shape, they are great mana receptors, and outputters.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="jagged">
            <h3>Jagged Crystal</h3>
            <h2>Rare</h2>
            <p>
                Jagged Crystals are not as common as Rounded, but are pretty much the exact same.  
                It is said that at one point Jagged Crystals were Rounded Crystals, but years of pressure changed their shape.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="peaked">
            <h3>Peaked Crystal</h3>
            <h2>Very Rare</h2>
            <p>
                While Peaked Crystals are very rare, it is still not impossible to find.  
                In fact, you will probably find a good amount of Wizards with one.  
                Its spikey nature adds for a more explosive spell casting style. 
                 Typically more powerful output, however its mana reception is not as controlled as a Rounded Crystal.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="lopsided">
            <h3>Lopsided Crystal</h3>
            <h2>Rare</h2>
            <p>
                Lopsided Crystals are the least liked among the Crystal families.  
                They are very poor in mana reception, and their output is never quite good.  
                Most often refer to them as the ‘Broken Crystal’.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="smoothed">
            <h3>Smoothed Crystal</h3>
            <h2>Very Rare</h2>
            <p>
                Though they are classified in the same rarity as Jagged Crystals, these are truly hard to come across. 
                 A Smoothed Crystal is said to be a perfect crystal. 
                 It combines the aspects of both a Rounded and Jagged Crystal, making it superb for spellcasting.

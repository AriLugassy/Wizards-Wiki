                <h2>Wizard Spells</h2>
                <h3>Types of Spells</h3>
                <p>Wizard spells can be categorized into several types based on their effects:</p>
                <ul class="list">
                    <li>Elemental Spells: Control the forces of nature, like fire, water, air, and earth.</li>
                    <li>Healing Spells: Restore health and cure ailments.</li>
                    <li>Enchantments: Bestow magical properties upon objects.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Spell Casting Techniques</h3>
                <p>Casting a spell is not as simple as learning, and casting.  
                    The art of a spell takes time to master, as do most things in this wonderful world. 
                     Any man can pick up a staff, but not every man can weild it.  
                    That is what will separate you from the rest.  
                    Certain spells require flicks and swooshes, perhaps a small phrase, and some need extreme focus.  
                    Learning the specifics, will make you an all around better spell caster.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Physical Strength</h3>
                <p>Most Wizards have very low physical strength, and little to no hand to hand combat knowledge.  
                    You may wonder why this is important, as do most.  
                    Proper physique will greatly improve your spell casting potency. 
                     Be prepared for close quarters combat, as not all your enemies will be Wizards.  
                    Strengthening yourself and your muscles will directly affect how strong your spells are.  Just as you train to learn a spell, train to cast it as well.   
                    As the great Wizard of Light, Marshfinkle once said, “ A physically able Wizard, is a physically capable Wizard.”

            <h2>Wizard Staffs</h2>
            <h3>Symbolism and Design</h3>
            <p>While they can aid in walking, they offer so much more.  
                Composed of wood and a Magic Crystal, these weapons offer a form of authority and power.  
                Of course, as with everything, there are some staffs that are more powerful than others. 
                 A Wizard carries out his daily duties, magic or not, with these beautiful weapons.  
                Here you can learn about them, as well as what makes certain staffs so sought after.</p>

        <h2>Elemental Spells</h2>
        <p>These spells hinge strongly on the use of the natural elements of the world.  
            These are by far the most common types of spells used, however higher level wizards know how to combine them to make them much more formidable. 
             What we have here are just a few of the simplest spells. 
             All of which can also be combined in some way.</p>

            </h4>
            <p>
                The Fireball spell is fairly common.  This is due to its extremely easy mastery level in addition to its low mana cost.  
                For such a simple spell, it packs a good bit of heat. Literally.

                This is a greatly renowned fire spell in the wizard world. Those who can cast it are of a different breed.  
                This spell spawns a miniature Sun and slings it towards an enemy causing a great fiery explosion.  
                Its destruction is formidable, with enough power to destroy entire forests.

            <p>
                Water wall is a common form of defense and offense. 
                 What makes it special is that unlike other forms of defense spells, Water Wall can be pushed forward at will. 
                This can be useful to help control the battlefield. 
                 Additionally, this amount of water can be reused for other water spells.

            <p>
                Summoning a swirling mass of water and wind, this spell is made for destruction. 
                 It is very uncommon that one can survive being sucked into such a spell.
                  Its size alone requires a great mastery in the element of Water, let alone enough focus and strength to keep it going.

                Summon a Bolt of lightening to shoot at your foes.  
                This spell conjures up quickly, and fires in the blink of an eye. 
                 It damage is effective and hard to evade.  This is a great middle-level spell.

                Create a thunderstorm to control at your will.  
                Firing constant lighting bolts strong enough to destroy castle walls, this spell is not to be taken lightly. 
                 It is very uncommon to encounter this spell as it takes a mastery of multiple elements before you can perform Super Conductor.

                Combine the Earth around you to create a boulder to use at your disposal. 
                 Boulders range in size depending on the Wizard who wields them. 
                 Some have even gotten so skilled they can create multiple at once.

                Use your own pure strength to shift the land beneath your feet.  
                Cause earthquakes that terraform and destroy the earth one sits upon.  
                Such a spell as destructive as this one is impossible to control.  
                One can only cast and hope they don't die from the aftermath.

                Twirl the wind around you into discs that slice through the air like razors.  
                The more skilled the Wizard, the more discs you can create.  
                Though these can be dispelled quite easily, they are quick and ferocious.  
                They are quite handy when thet are thrown in at random.

                Create a devastating twister that picks up and throws anything in its path.  
                Such a spell is wondrous for crowd control and destroying enemy artillery.  
                This spell can also be mixed with any flame spell to create a formidable combination.

        <h2>Healing Spells</h2>
        <p>
            These spells are used to aid in ones healing, or in some cases completely reverse the damage done to ones self.
              In most cases a Wizard would specialize specifically in healing and medicines,
               however some Wizards learn a spell or two for their own safety.

            <p>Lesser heal is great for healing small cuts and bruises. 
                 It also helps quicken the mitosis process for slightly deeper cuts.

                Deeper and more serious stabs or gashes along with fractures would be handled with the help of this spell.
                  Any form of cuts that need stitches would be healed by this spell.  
                  Greater heal also takes significantly longer to execute.

        <p>
            Some Wizards like to rely on a Sword in addition to their staff.  
            This would in turn provide them with another form of close quarters combat defense, and they would not have to rely as heavily on spell casting.  
            To further increase their swords abilities, they will often enchant them.  
            Enchantments last for a set time frame of usually a few minutes.  
            They require a decent amount of focus, and since it lasts for a duration they take a substantial amount of mana.

                Fairly straight forward this one is. 
                 It imbues your sword temporarily with flames, not only adding a burning trail to your swings,
                  but the sword itself becomes incredibly hot.
